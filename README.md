# Password-complexity-calculator
This is a simplistic excel sheet doing rough calculations on the time it will take to find a password of a certain size and complexity, by brute force. In other words, the program calculates how many different combinations can be produced after inserting the size of the alphabet (e.g., only letters, small & capitals, numbers, special symbols). Then the user can also insert the number of password checks per second. In order to find this number, the user can look into the internet for example on how many calculations per second can be produced by a super computer. ATTENTION: The following calculations are not accurate since they are missing a lot of information such as the software used, the cryptography scheme, etc. It also does not take into account the hash function used. As such, it can only be used for educational purposes only, and only as a rough measure of magnitute of passwords complexity.
